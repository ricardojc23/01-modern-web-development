# Manage Dependencies with NPM

* Create a `package.json` file in this folder
  * `npm init -y`
* Add `"type": "module"` to the `package.json` file
  * This will allow us to use `import` and `export`
* Install the `date-fns` library
* Create a file called `index.js`
  * Import at least 3 functions from the `date-fns` library
    * See the `date-fns` [website](https://date-fns.org/) for more information
  * Use / call those 3 functions
